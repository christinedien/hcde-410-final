    "## Motivation and problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am planning to analyze a dataset about student alcohol consumption. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption). I am planning to do this analysis to learn more about whether extrinsic factors can contribute to alcohol use in students. Also, it would be interesting to see if there is a coorelation between alcohol consumption and grades. I think it could be interesting to see if there is any significant coorelation between urban and rural students with alcohol use.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a human-centered perspective I think it can be a bit dangerous to find a coorelation between alcohol use and grades, if it falls into the wrong hands. I think that if people find a coorelation for example that students living in more rural areas are more likely to drink, and then get poor grades, there can be some biases held against students from more rural areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for this project is to explore how extrinsic factors like sex, family size, mother and father's job, and internet access could influence alcohol consumption in students. I also want to see if there is significant coorelation between excessive alcohol usage with some of these variables. This can inform people on factors that might be damaging towards student health and performance. People would then be able to work towards alleviating those negative influences. For example, if high travel time is associated with more alcohol usuage, cities could try to make schools more accessible to students by improving transportation or adding more schools to improve proximity to students. Same goes for factors that seem to decrease alcohol usage and improve performance. If more extra curricular activies are better for students, schools could try to make these more accessible to students by lowering the cost barrier to participate and encouraging students more. I also hope to practice data wrangling and visualization with this project.\n",

    "### Dataset Access and Licensing\n",
    "* The dataset can be found and downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption).\n",
    "* The source paper for the data can be explored [here](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf)\n",
    "* The data has a **CC0: Public Domain License**\n",
    "* The schools and students voluntarily participated in the original study. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is suitable for my goals becuase it is a publically available dataset that has collected a lot of information about student demographics and their alcohol usage. As stated above one ethical consideration about using this dataset is that there is a chance that people could use the datset to back up claims about students with malicious intent, causing others to hold biases against certain groups of students. Another thing to keep in mind is that in the original study, I believe the intent of using this dataset was to see if people could predict what a student's performace would be in order to \"enhancing school resource management.\" It may not be  appropriate to try to predict how well a student will do just based on their home life and other factors like sex and parent education. Another bias that might be in the data is that the data was only collected from two schools in one region in Portugual, which could have some representation bias, especially if people are trying to use this data to model or draw conclusions about students in other countries\n",

    "## Unknowns and dependencies: \n",
    "\n",
    "I think I should be able to finish the project in time. I am getting my second shot next Tuesday, so I might turn in my Final Project plan a little late if I get bad side effects(since it due that Wednesday), but I will try to work on it earlier. I may be going back home to visit my grandma due to some health problems in late May, but I should be able to finish the project.\n"

    "## Background and/or Related Work:\n",
    "I wanted to look at students and drinking in a variety of countries. The dataset represents Portuguese students. In an overview, Rehm et al, 2003 compared alcohol comsumption in people age 15 and older around the world using the WHO data. They had the following conclusions:\n",
    "- Average alcohol consumption was highest in Europe, the Americas, and established market economies such as Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, although there were exceptions (e.g., the Muslim countries of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the least developed countries in South and Central America).\n",
    "- Average alcohol consumption generally was lower in Africa and Asia.\n",
    "- Alcohol consumption was particularly low in the Muslim countries in the eastern Mediterranean region and on the Indian subcontinent.\n",
    "The aboved mentioned study and others can be found at this [review paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6601676/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### United States:\n",
    "- There have been many studies looking into what causes a higher influence for students to engage in drinking or binge drinking. For example, in the US, drinking alcohol is so prevalent amongst college students. In a national survey, almost 53% of full-time college students ages 18 to 22 drank alcohol in the past month. About 33% engaged in binge drinking during that same time frame [[1].](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt29394/NSDUHDetailedTabs2019/NSDUHDetTabsSect6pe2019.htm#tab6-21b)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For college students in the US, there are trends that associate living in denser living arrangements with other college peers, such fraternities and sororities, with higher rates of alcohol consumption. Non-college peers have a lower rate of drinking, as well as college peers who live with thier families. It is thought that factors like the availabilty of alcohol, the drinking culture on college campuses, and the inconsistent enforcement of underage drinking laws all attribute to heavy drinking in college students. This is especially true of the first few months of someone's college experience [[2].](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/college-drinking)\n",

    "On this [website](https://www.alcohol.org.nz/help-advice/advice-on-alcohol/for-parents/factors-that-influence-young-peoples-drinking), they found the following factors to be influential towards teenage drinking:\n",
    "* early introduction to alcohol\n",
    "* exposure to adult binge drinking or alcohol dependence\n",
    "* access to alcohol from parents and others\n",
    "* friends who drink heavily\n",

    "## Methodology: \n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to answer my questions with the following steps:\n",
    "1. Data cleaning and preparation\n",
    "    * Do some exploratory visualization of the data to get familiar with its shape and content\n",
    "        * Scatter plots, bar charts, line plots\n",
    "    * Get rid of null data\n",
    "    * Manipulate data into a workable format if necessary (maybe pivot)\n",
    "    * Subset dataframe if needed to answer specific questions.\n",
    "2. Check for biases:\n",
    "    * Missing data (this is previously being taken care of when getting rid of null values)\n",
    "    * Duplication bias\n",
    "    * Underrepresentation bias\n",
    "        * What are the demographics of the students involved? Is there a good spread of all the different factors/combinations of factors?\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Data analysis steps\n",
    "    * Find coorelation (make a coorelation matrix maybe) between alcohol consumption and different factors\n",
    "    * How does alcohol consumption increase or decrease with different amounts of study time?\n",
    "    * How does the amount of free time relate the the amount of study time?\n",
    "    * Train a basic regression model to try to predict the amount of alcohol consumption based on different factors\n",
    "    * ***MAYBE NOT ETHICAL!*** Train a model to predict the grades of students based on different factors (this was the original goal of the people who had the dataset)\n",
    "    * Perform PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset\n",
    "        * There are a lot of different values collected for each student. It would be nice to understand which factors are contributing the most to the variation in the dataset\n",
    "4. Data Visualization steps:\n",
    "    * Scatter plots for depecting coorelation and relationships between two variables\n",
    "        * Scatterplots are really helpful to show positive, negative, or no coorelation between two continuous variables. Can take a lot of factors and\n",
    "    * Barplots to show demographics of students\n",
    "    * Heatmap to show alcohol consumption levels for different factors\n",
    "        * The color would likely show amount of alcohol\n",
    "        * Each row could be a different student\n",
    "        * Along the x-axis, a continuous variable like `studytime` or `freetime`\n",
    "    * PCA plot showing PC1 and PC2 for the dataset\n",
    "        * A nice two-dimensional view of the dataset while still considering all the dimensions collected"
