Underage drinking in students is a problem that affects many countries. For example, in the US where the legal drinking age is 21, it is well known that many students participate in underage drinking. Underaged binge drinking in particular, can be extremely dangerous. it can lead to alcohol poisioning and cause other alcohol related deaths. The purpose of this project is to look at extrinsic factors of a students life and see if there are coorelations between these factors and their alcohol consumption. Through analyzing a dataset collected on secondary school students from Portugual, where the drinking age is 18, I found levels of alcohol consumption dropped when the perceived quality of family relationships was higher. Additionally, less travel time was associated with  less alcohol on average. These coorelations can help to inform parents to place more effort on increasing the quality of family relationships. Public policy makers can try to work on areas that might be coorelated with less underage alcohol levels, such as decreasing communte time with more schools or improved transportation.
